# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Project

## 📚 Introduction

This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript course**. The goal is to create a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the browser. This project helped me understand how to structure code using objects and modules, and how to manipulate the DOM.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

First, I set up my project with the necessary **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files**. I also initialized a Git repository to track my progress.

## 🎲 Gameboard Object

I started by creating a `Gameboard` object to store the game state. The gameboard is represented as an array.

## 👤 Player Object

Next, I created a `Player` object to store player information.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project was a great way to practice JavaScript and understand the importance of organizing code using objects and modules. It also reinforced the concept of separating logic from the DOM manipulation. I enjoyed the challenge and learned a lot from it!
